I am a 20-year-old software developer based in Moscow ðŸ‡·ðŸ‡º.

I started programming in 2015, having entered the Moscow School of Programmers in Yandex. Later Iâ€™ve finished HSE Lyceum (specialization in mathematics and computer science) and went to Higher School of Economics University, Moscow, Russia.

Currently I'm getting a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science. I'm graduating in 2023.

Since autumn 2019 I'm also a backend developer of the [PPnP team](https://ppnp.me 'official team website'). We launch startups, participate in hackathons and work on commercial projects.
